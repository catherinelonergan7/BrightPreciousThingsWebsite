			<!-- about section -->
			<!-- I looked at getBootsrap (listed in bibliography) for justify-content-md-center, origianlly I was going to do Justify content start on About
			and Justify content end on Woodland so that they looked like the home page on Extravagant Photos but it did not work out
			and just looked strange so I decided to just go simple and center them, I did the same for the contact page-->

			<h4>  About the Artist</h4>
			<p>Dublin born artist Catherine Lonergan creates unique art pieces and water colour cards. 
			She works under the name Bright Precious Things which comes from a quote from the Great Gatsby
			by F. Scott Fitzgerald “all the bright, precious things fade so fast and they don’t come back.”
			Art can preserve these bright precious moments in life like a fly trapped in amber. 
			By using techniques such as pressing flowers which would decay otherwise, beauty can be captured 
			and preserved.  Catherine works in various mediums such as acrylic, watercolour, pastels, 
			and mixed media. She can accommodate requests to suit the client’s needs.  Prices are available
			by request. You can contact her though the <a href = "contact.html">contact page.</a> </p>

			<h4> About the Woodland Series </h4>
			<p>Catherine completed a series of artworks based on the four corners woodlands of Rathcoole. 
			Collecting twigs, branches, and flowers she incorporated them into the paintings. The series 
			was inspired by the need to preserve this woodland area which is under threat now. There have
			been plans to demolish the woodlands. For more information on this you can go to the Four corners 
			Woodland Group Facebook page <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/FourDistrictsWoodland/?ref=page_internal">here.</a> If you wish to sign a petition to stop this from happening,
			you can click <a href = "https://my.uplift.ie/petitions/save-our-four-districts-woodland-habitat"> here.</a> </p>
